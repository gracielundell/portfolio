          A mobile app to help gardeners track their gardens from year to year. This app was designed to fill the niche found in most gardening apps: something to allow users to easily plan out their spaces as well as implementation of calendar and journal capabilities.

        <h1>Preparation</h1>
        <p>
          Grow was inspired by the lack I found when perusing garden apps for a useful and easy-to-use plot-planning feature. I wanted something that had a journal feature to keep notes on how my garden was doing: what I could improve on, planting/harvesting dates, and what was to be grown that year. I wanted to create an app that incorporated all these features and could flow between them easily and sensibly.
        <p>
        <p>
          When researching gardening apps, most of the ones I found implemented one or two of these desired features; I had a hard time finding one meeting all of my needs. The timeline for this project was collectively about a week and a half.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feature I focused most on, or what I thought would be the main draw of the app was the idea of having a virtual plot for gardeners to use as a way to plan out plant placement. People would be able to pick from a wide array of commonly grown plants, set their dimensions, and then use the plants they selected to populate a grid. This became my main focus and what the rest of the app was somewhat constructed around.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prepare, I began by looking at other gardening apps with similar features. I noted their color palettes and choice of features. I also searched images of backyard gardens, creating a palette from the colors I saw most frequently. I myself as an aspiring gardener, was drawn to colors that represent flowers, dirt, bugs, and of course greens in all ranges.
        </p>
        <h1>Ideation</h1>
        <p>
          I scoured the site, Pexels, for images that I felt represented feelings of gardening, growth, playfulness, and an understanding of the accomplishment of being one with nature in your own backyard.  I put together moodboards of the images that most coincided with these ideology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I proceded to find fonts that exemplified these same feelings, as well as worked well together. Amatic has been a favorite for a long time, and I was excited to have a project where it could be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colors were drawn from the images, as well as from my own garden.
